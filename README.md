# Weather-App

## Introduction

We going to develop a real weather application by putting into use Asynchronous JavaScript features.  

In this application we are going to :  

* Create asynchronous non-blocking program in the form of a weather application
* The app will communicate with 3rd party weather API
  * Google Geolocation
  * Yahoo weather API
* The app will fetch data from these sources using Async HTTP request

Features to use : callback, promises, http call and more...  

## Async Basics (branch: 01-async-basics)

In this branch :

* we go over the basics of JavaScript Async programming  
* play around with async features

The code is the branch will not be part of the weather app but it will be really useful when it comes to create the weather app.
